For the final project I have selected to review a Bollywood movie ’83’. This movie is based on the Indian cricket team winning their first ever world cup in 1983 against all odds. 

I have chosen to review this movie as it showcases emotions, empathy, friendship, leadership, dedication, motivational dialogues and patriotism. 

This movie is currently available for streaming on Netflix USA.
